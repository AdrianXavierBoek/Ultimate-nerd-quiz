    <h1>The ultimate nerd test</h1>
    
    <div class="survey-description">
        <p>In this survey, you score each theme from 0 to a maximum value (that’s the number right after ‘1 - ’). Why are the max values different? It’s not that deep bro just roll with it. Your total score will be based on your responses, with the highest score being 6825. The higher your score, the more nerdy you are. Here's what that numbers mean:</p>
        
        <ul>
    <li><strong>0-500:</strong> <em>Casual Muggle</em>  
      <p>You're here for the ride, but you’re not risking a full dive into the nerd pool just yet. Maybe you know who Harry Potter is, but you don’t know the difference between Gryffindor and Slytherin. You’ve probably enjoyed a Marvel movie or two, but you still need help with your fandom homework. Not fully committed, but you're taking a curious peek through the fandom window.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>501-1000:</strong> <em>Casual Gamer</em>  
      <p>You know your way around a few fandoms, and you’re definitely that person who can quote Pokémon but still can’t remember which came first: Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts. You’ve dabbled in anime, gaming, and fandoms like a buffet—grabbing a bit here and there. You’re starting to see what’s out there, but you haven’t fully unlocked your inner geek yet. It’s like you're leveling up... but still in the tutorial.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>1001-1500:</strong> <em>Wannabe Wizard</em>  
      <p>You’ve taken the plunge and started collecting Funko Pops, maybe snagged a Vocaloid figure or a Dungeons & Dragons dice set. You’ve been to a convention... or at least watched a livestream of one. You can’t help but hum a Miku song now and then, and you might have a few Naruto headbands laying around. You’re a fan in the making, but the true wizardry is still just beyond your reach.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>1501-2000:</strong> <em>Pokémon Trainer</em>  
      <p>You’ve picked your side—Attack on Titan over My Hero Academia, or maybe you’re ready to choose your Pokémon starter for the 10th time. You’ve played through the classics like Final Fantasy or Persona, and you know that Sailor Moon is superior to all other magical girls. You're a fandom connoisseur now, proudly showing off your collection of anime posters and action figures. You're not just a fan, you’re living the dream.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>2001-3000:</strong> <em>Dungeon Master</em>  
      <p>You've entered the fandom world and set up camp. Your Pokédex has more rare Pokémon than your friends' combined. You’re a walking anime encyclopedia and can quote One Piece and Fullmetal Alchemist in the same breath. You've rolled more than a few D20s, and you’re probably wearing a Legend of Zelda t-shirt as you read this. Fandoms aren’t just a hobby—they’re a way of life. You’ve got the credentials to back up every opinion.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>3001-4000:</strong> <em>Otaku Overlord</em>  
      <p>You’re an empire unto yourself in the fandom world. Conventions are like home, and you’ve been to more panels than your social battery can handle. You can name every One Piece arc and debate why Naruto Shippuden still isn’t better than Attack on Titan. Your room is basically a shrine to your favorite anime, and your cosplay is next-level. When people mention a character, you can already tell them their backstory and worst enemies. You are the fandom.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>4001-5000:</strong> <em>Vocaloid Virtuoso</em>  
      <p>You know more about Miku’s lore than most people know about their own childhoods. Your Star Wars theories are so complex that they could probably be turned into an epic saga. Your knowledge of fandom trivia is encyclopedic, and you've probably got Vocaloid songs on repeat while you write fanfic. You're the person everyone turns to for an explanation of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure lore or for tips on how to max out stats in Persona 5. Your nerdiness is a living, breathing art form.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>5001-6000:</strong> <em>Legendary Superfan</em>  
      <p>You’re the fandom guru—the one who knows every One Piece arc, can rattle off every Pokémon stat, and could probably teach a masterclass on Dungeons & Dragons character creation. You've got a collection that rivals museums, and you're the go-to expert whenever someone needs to know the difference between Naruto and Boruto. You've been around the block, and you've been the Anime expert in every conversation. You’re basically a nerd deity.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>6001-6825:</strong> <em>Master of the Multiverse</em> (Suspiciously high!)  
      <p>You’ve transcended fandom—you’ve become the fandom. Every Marvel movie line is etched into your soul. Your Vocaloid playlist could outlast Netflix’s entire catalog. You’ve been to every convention, can quote all the anime, and might have a few characters from Naruto on speed dial. You've started to question if your entire identity is just one big fandom. You might even start blending realities because, let’s face it, you’re on the verge of mastering the multiverse itself.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
        <p>Anything above 10,000? Yeah... we might need to check if you're secretly running a D&D campaign with your friends 24/7!</p>
